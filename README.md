# Coding Challenge - 01 (React/Styling)

### Setup
This challenge uses Gatsby. You may need to [install the Gatsby CLI](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/gatsby-cli/) to run the development environment. We recommend using Node 18. Spinning up the environment is not necessary but would help speed up completion and allow you to check your solution.

With the Gatsby CLI run `gatsby develop` in the gatsby folder to start a local dev instance. This should run on `localhost:8000` if there's nothing else running on that port.

We estimate this should take 15-30m.

### Challenge
The challenge is located on the `/challenge/` route. 

### Submission
Read through the directions and share the GitHub repository link or share the solution code via contact.
